    <h2>Our Sponsors</h2>

  <section id="about">
    <div>
      <h1>Learning is leading us.</h1>
      <!-- Deixar bem claro o que nos move -->
      <p>
        As group of students, we know the knowledge we were getting from university is not enough.<br>
        Under the suggestion and guidance of an older, more experienced colleague, we started Hackathonners where, in <i>hackathon</i>-like meetings, we bring our ideas to the real world.

      <h2>Our lemma sounds like us.</h2>
      <!-- Pequeno texto sobre o que quer dizer o nosso lema -->
      <p>
        <b>A bunch of people who build things</b>.
        <b>A bunch of people</b> because we aim to be a big group, whilst for now we are big in hard-work and motivation. <br>
        <b>Build</b> because we believe in a thinking-before-coding approach and also in the fact that creating a piece of software can be as innovating, challenging and laborious as building a skyscraper.<br>
        <b>Things</b> because we are open to all types of software. On one hackathon we might be developing for Android or iOS, but on the next we will be using NoSQL databases on a web application while on the one after that we might be creating an Arduino project.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>We think big.</h2>
      <!-- Pequeno Texto sobre qual é o nosso objetivo com este projeto. -->
      <p>
        We aim to acquire and share knowledge and use it to contribute to open-source with pieces of complete software.
        We improve skills such as team-working and speaking.
        We want to scale our current work model to have hackathons with more people.
